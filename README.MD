# Ideas
## Advertising contract execution app (AdChain)
- Alice the advertiser wants to advertise a product, and knows Chris the content creator has a solid following on Youtube.
- Alice wants to buy time on Chris's video. She wants the ad to be part of the video, such as 
Chris saying "Thanks to our sponsor Alice, check her out at alicesplace.com"
- Chris makes a video with Alice's Ad in it.
- Alice and Chris use AdChain to create a contract, which specifies the terms of payment guaranteed by the blockchain. For example:
    - Payment of $10 is made when views hit 1,000
    - Payment of $100 is made when views hit 10,000
    - Payment of $1000 is made when views hit 100,000. Therefore, the maximum payment in this contract is $1110.
- Alice and Chris have their own Ethereum wallet addresses. In order for the contract to execute, Alice must approve 
Chris's video, verifying that the ad is in the video and is up to her standards. FUTURE WORK- this step could be automated
with some auto-verification via some kind of bot that searches for keywords, etc.
- The contract is funded by Alice (?), who may need some staking to fund several of these contracts.
- Chainlink uses an Oracle node to watch the viewcount, and when it passes the set amount of views, the contract executes.

Is that it?

# Dead ideas:
## Quiz game
- Dealer chooses a
- Dealer chooses a question, like "Who won the Super Bowl last year?", from a list of 3-5 questions. These questions/answers would need to come from a pool of quiz questions, this all relies on the existence of this pool.
- They would want to choose something they think they know but think others don't know.
- Dealer enters their answer
- The question is presented to the other players
- They choose their answer (bonus points if they can guess the dealer's wrong answer?)
- All is revealed. Dealer should get extra negative points for not knowing something they said they knew

Turns out source of truth for such a quiz game would be really hard! And not too interesting of a problem for Chainlink.

## Shipping contract completion app
### Concept:
- Shipping contract completion
- Contract is created by an item being scanned at a warehouse
- Contract requires that an item be delivered by x date, and y location
- Source of truth for GPS is the (web)app, source of truth for the time is the local time. A "real" application would need some kind of verification especially on the GPS part. A native app would probably be necessary.
- Can Chainlink use a device's GPS as a Chainlink Node?! Then we're golden!
- When device is brought within time/position window, it fulfills the contract, completing the transaction.
- Best case would be the money is held in escrow by Chainlink's infrastructure, released to the deliverer when completed, refunded to consumer if the window passes.



## TODO
Do this! Send transaction. Need to import existing wallet with eth, presumably.
